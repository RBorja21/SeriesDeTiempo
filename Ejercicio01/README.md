Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. 

JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! 

The investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Milion monthly user in next 19 months. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on -jetRail for next 7 months.
